# BrandPilot

BrandPilot is a full-featured blog creation platform powered by Google Gemini AI. Create, publish, and share engaging blog content with user authentication, MongoDB storage, and multilingual support.

## Problem Weâ€™re Solving

Writing and sharing blogs takes too much time and effort.

People often have to use different tools for writing, formatting, SEO checks, and then manually posting on social media. It becomes messy, slow, and confusing â€” especially for beginners or non-technical users.

Some common problems:
- No simple way to turn blogs into LinkedIn posts or Twitter threads  
- No one-click sharing to Instagram, LinkedIn, or other platforms  
- Hard to know how many people read your blog  
- No built-in voice-to-text support  
- No AI to improve writing or help with SEO  
- No support for writing in multiple languages  
- Customizing the blog design is not easy

Because of all this, many people give up before they even publish.
